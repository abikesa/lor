Dear Halsted faculty, 
see request and link below that you take a short Implicit Association test before the faculty meeting if you plan to attend (please do).  If you hit the link below it will give you the option for a bunch of different tests but we are instructed to select the “Gender-Career-IAT”.  I did it already, it was interesting and took only about 5 minutes.  you get some feedback too.
Andrew
